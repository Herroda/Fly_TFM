"""Forward-model traction inversion (displacement input) with a soft support prior.

This ports the validated *log-soft mask confinement* from the photometric one-shot
prototype (napariTFM2.5D ``oneshot.py``) onto the **displacement field** as input,
so the confinement rides the validated PIV/FFD front-end instead of the fragile
image-formation model (PSF, bleaching, out-of-plane motion). The photometric
variant underperformed on real data precisely because it was hostage to that model;
taking the displacement field as input drops bead texture and warp modelling out
entirely.

For each frame we solve for the surface traction ``t`` (Pa) by minimizing

    J(t) = ? W · (G·t ? u) ?²  +  ?²?t?²  +  ?? t·(1?p) ?²

- ``G`` is the *same* Boussinesq / finite-thickness Green's operator FTTC inverts
  (reused verbatim from :mod:`napariTFM.backend.fttc`; folds in E, ?, gel_height,
  pixel_size). ``û = G·t?`` maps traction ? displacement per Fourier mode.
- ``?`` is the Tikhonov amplitude ridge ? the *same* ``regularization`` dial FTTC
  uses, entering as the identical physical ``?²?t?²`` penalty on both the ?=0
  (closed-form) and ?>0 (iterative) branches so the dial means one thing throughout.
  It is the sole traction-field regularizer on both branches (there is no separate
  gradient-smoothness prior).
- ``?`` is the soft support prior ? the off-mask penalty, applied to ``t·(1?p)`` where
  ``p`` is the support-probability map (:func:`support_probability`). There is
  deliberately no hard gate: the one-shot benchmark found gating clips genuine
  near-edge forces (|t| r 0.95 vs 0.99 for strong-soft), so "maximum confinement" is
  strong soft.
- ``R`` (``fwd_mask_reach``) sets *where* the boundary is: the free region is the mask
  grown outward by R px (``p ? 1`` there, a zero-penalty apron), and beyond it the
  penalty ramps up over a small fixed anti-ring edge (:func:`support_probability`). R is
  orthogonal to ? *in effect*: because the apron is genuinely zero-penalty, ? cannot
  shrink it, so R still moves the boundary at maximum strength (? sets *how hard* the
  exterior is pushed, R sets *how far out* forces are still allowed). Same map feeds the
  L1 route's soft support.
- ``W`` is an optional *fit-region weight*: it trusts the displacement only inside
  ``mask`` dilated by ``fwd_fit_margin_um``. The photometric MVP had this as
  ``fit_margin_um`` and it matters here too ? without it, a neighbour cell's
  displacement sitting in the crop *demands* forces to explain it while ? *forbids*
  off-mask forces, and the solver dumps residual stress onto the mask boundary.

The problem is a convex quadratic in ``t``, so:

- **? = 0 ? closed form.** With no confinement, ? is diagonal in Fourier and the
  per-mode 2×2 Tikhonov solve ``t? = (G?G + ?²I)?¹ G? û`` reuses FTTC's exact
  machinery. Pure numpy/FFT; no torch required.
- **? > 0 ? iterative.** The support term couples Fourier modes, so
  we solve the (still convex) QP as its normal equations ``A t = b`` by preconditioned
  Conjugate Gradient, with the Fourier-diagonal ?=0 operator as the preconditioner
  (see docs/specs/forward-solver-pcg.md). ``A`` is SPD, so CG is exact in exact
  arithmetic. The operator is one array-module-agnostic (numpy | cupy) function ? no
  autograd, no torch ? so the CPU path is torch-free and the GPU path is CuPy.

Output contract matches FTTC: traction ``(2, H, W)`` float32 in Pa, ``[0] = t_x``.
